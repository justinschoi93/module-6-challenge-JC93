## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://justinschoi93.github.io/module-6-challenge-JC93/)

I created a weather app from scratch using HTML, CSS, javascript, and APIs from OpenWeather. 


## Usage 

Search for the city you'd like to see the weather for... and voila!

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Learning Points 

The purpose of this project was to practice requesting, reformatting and parsing through data through the use of an API. It was also a great opportunity to practice the basics of HTML, CSS and javascript.
